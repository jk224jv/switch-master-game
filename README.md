# Tiny Tunes

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will start working against (pun intended) the DOM API.

For this exercise, it is OK to place the code needed in index.js. Later on, you will look at separating your JavaScript more cleanly. If you like, please go ahead and put the code in a separate helper module.

Start the exercise by:

```bash
npm i
```

followed by:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The instructions will be served by index.html.
